    <div class="about">
        <p class="subtitle"> Backstory </p>
        <div class="text"> You work at a fast food restaurant in your city and your boss calls out sick. It's your responsibility to keep the place running all on your own. If you fail to serve every customer as fast as possible with the appropriate food, you are fired and lose the game.</div>
        <p class="subtitle"> Objective </p>
        <div class="text"> Customers run from all sides towards the center where you are serving food. To stop the customers you have to shoot the correct order at them before they reach your food station. If you succeed in shooting the correct order to all the customers in the time frame, you win and move on to the next level. As you move up in the levels, the difficulty levels increase (meaning the customers run faster at you and possibly have an order of multiple items).</div>
        <p class="subtitle"> Gameplay </p>
        <div class="text">To select an item the gamer will use their mouse to scroll, and left click to shoot. To aim there is a constant trajectory arrow that will follow the pointer (from the mouse).</div>
    <div></div>
